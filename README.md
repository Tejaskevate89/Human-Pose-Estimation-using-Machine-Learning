Human Pose Estimation (HPE) refers to the task of detecting and tracking the human body in digital images or videos. The goal is to identify the positions of key body joints (such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles) and represent the human pose using a skeleton. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has become a key tool in achieving high-performance pose estimation.

This project uses machine learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to perform Human Pose Estimation. The system is designed to estimate and track human poses in real-time from images or video frames.
